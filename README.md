# Ip_Calculator

This android application helps to get the subnet in the given IP address by taking the input as IP address and Number of subnet that user wants in the network

Subentting - A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses.
